NOTES FOR PROJECT

9/10/15
we discovered that reading data into a table, we get errors any time there is an apostrophe or #. we removed them.


QUESTIONS
is there some sort of unique identifier for the grant request? this is important to have so that we do not have duplicate information.

It is also helpful to have unique identifiers for the investigators. This way we do not run the risk of identifying two different people who happen to have the same name. V-numbers would be great if everyone is a VCU researcher.

While each grant proposal now appears to be unique, there are some (maybe somehow figure out how many?) that are very similar except for a few minor changes to the project title, for example. this could negatively influence the data by duplicating pairs.

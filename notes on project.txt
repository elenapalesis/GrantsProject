NOTES FOR PROJECT

9/10/15
we discovered that when reading data into a tab delimited table, we get errors any time there is an apostrophe or # so we removed them.


QUESTIONS
is there some sort of unique identifier for the grant request? this is important to have so that we do not have duplicate information.

ANSWER: Yes, it turns out that for some reason Institution Number actually means Grant ID. Do not ask why.

It is also helpful to have unique identifiers for the investigators. This way we do not run the risk of identifying two different people who happen to have the same name. V-numbers would be great if everyone is a VCU researcher.

As of 09/15/15, we still do not have a set of Investigator IDs.

9/11/15
While each grant proposal now appears to be unique, there are some (maybe somehow figure out how many?) that are very similar except for a few minor changes to the project title, for example. this could negatively influence the data by duplicating pairs.


a few words on the database
the grant collaborations data consists of a table representing information about grant proposals and the Investigators who collaborated on each grant.

The data provided includes multiple rows for each period of the grant.

step 1 of processing:
While exploring the data,
we discovered that to be processed correctly by R, when reading data into a tab delimited table, we get errors any time there is an apostrophe or # so we removed them.

grants-2015-expanded-PROCESS.xlcx
in process grants-2015-expanded tab, we sorted by Grant ID
so we create additional columns:

Grant Changed	Total Granted	Line Keep	Team size	Awarded	Sponsor contains National Institute	Sponsor contains NIH	NIH Grant	Awarded NIH

These columns contain the logic for getting the total amount granted over all periods for a grant, whether or not the grant was awarded.

So now we copy the table and paste values only into new sheet grants-2015-expanded
we sort by line-keep and delete all rows containing zeros to remove duplicates
and we also remove un needed columns such as: grant changed, period total awarded, line keep, sponsor contains National Institute, Sponsor contains NIH, and keep the rest.

we copy/pasted into a new worksheet again with the same title "grants-2015-expanded" to eliminate the annoying blank rows and columns.

Then we save the excel version .xlcx and then we export the last worksheet we created as a tab delimited text file to be processed by our File Build R codes.

a question we face: what should we do when we have missing investigator information like names, department? do we throw those files away?

papa: relationships that involve blank unnamed investigators should be thrown out
elena: the entire grant should be thrown out.

We decided to leave the blanks in for the names for now until we are ready to perform analysis on them. We will decide then.

Sometimes, the investigator name is blank but the department is provided which gives us information about how those who proposed the grant envisioned the potential collaboration.


We have 2 R codes : 'grantdatabuild-2015-two-mode.R' the first one generates from the grantsNew-1015-expanded file a two-mode in which for each grant we create connections between the institution ID and each individual investigator participating in the grant.

'grantdatabuild-2015-pairs2.R' the second one generates a table of pairwise relationships among all investigators participating in a grant project.
